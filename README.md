This readme is for the moment to have an update on the progress of the project.
First meeting:
- Have a first look on the data
- Look on other project on image segmentation, classification
- Have a look on Kaggles to see the best models for segmentation
- Get familiar with neural networks, CNN
- Get familiar with TensorFlow
- Look on the templates provided from the ML course
- Use CNN as basis model and use assemble learning (watch out on the overfitting)
- Find relevant code source with CNN (use for text or image classification)
- Get familiar with U-Net. 


Relevant source.
